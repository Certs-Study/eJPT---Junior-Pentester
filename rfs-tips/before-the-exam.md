# Before the Exam

Before starting the exam I recommend you to sleep well and after that have a great meal.

Remember to **Take a shower** before the Exam and clean your desk.

Go to the super market and buy some food and drinks for you and if you have a pet like me buy to it too and clean the toilet.

If you have anything in your mind to do, do it before starting the exam.&#x20;

Just clean your head!

### Coffee?&#x20;

Reload the machine, and if you smoke buy all the papers you need.

### Mobile Phone

Just turn it off while you are Hacking! You being prepare for the real World :P

### Backups

Before start the exam verify if you have backups of all virtual machines you need or tools, documentation, binaries. If you can afford a dedicated external disk to all you security/certification stuff, do it!
