# Command Injection

### Command Injection

Command Injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application executes arbitrary commands given by an attacker. This flaw exists because the application does not properly validate user input, allowing attackers to execute potentially harmful commands directly on the host operating system. It is a critical vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.

#### Prevention:

* **Input Validation:** Ensure all user input is strictly validated against a whitelist.
* **Use Safe APIs:** Whenever possible, use safe API calls that do not involve shell commands.
* **Escaping:** If shell commands must be used, ensure all user inputs are correctly escaped.
* **Least Privilege:** Run applications with the least privileges necessary to reduce the impact of a successful attack.

#### Explanation of Command Injection

Command Injection attacks exploit the way an application processes user input to execute unintended commands on the host system. Attackers can manipulate inputs to trigger these commands, leading to unauthorized access or control over the system. This vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation, enabling attackers to inject harmful commands that the application executes without knowing their malicious intent.&#x20;

Preventing Command Injection requires rigorous input validation, the use of safer API alternatives that avoid shell commands, proper escaping of inputs when shell commands are unavoidable, and implementing the principle of least privilege for application execution.

**Mitigation Techniques:**

* **Secure Coding Practices**: Adherence to secure coding standards can significantly mitigate the risk of command injection vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Code Audits**: Conducting
