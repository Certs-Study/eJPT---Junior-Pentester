# 6âƒ£ Windows Post Exploitation

Understanding post-exploitation methodologies in a Windows environment is crucial for cybersecurity professionals.&#x20;

Here's an overview of the Windows post-exploitation methodology:

1. **Information Gathering**
   * **System Identification:** Identify the Windows version, architecture, and patch level.
   * **User Enumeration:** Enumerate users and their privileges on the compromised system.
2. **Privilege Escalation**
   * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
   * **Abusing Service Permissions:** Exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in services to gain higher privileges.
   * **Token Manipulation:** Manipulate access tokens to escalate privileges.
3. **Maintaining Persistence**
   * **Registry Modifications:** Make registry changes to ensure persistence across reboots.
   * **Scheduled Tasks:** Create scheduled tasks for continuous access.
   * **Service Installation:** Install a malicious service to ensure persistence.
4. **Lateral Movement**
   * **Pass-the-Ticket (PtT):** Use Kerberos tickets for lateral movement.
   * **Pass-the-Hash (PtH):** Use compromised credentials to move laterally within the network.
   * **Exploiting Trust Relationships:** Leverage trust relationships between systems to move across the network.
5. **Data Exfiltration**
   * **Compression and Encryption:** Compress and encrypt sensitive data before exfiltration.
   * **Covert Channels:** Use covert channels for stealthy data transfer.
6. **Covering Tracks**
   * **Log Tampering:** Modify or delete logs to erase traces of the compromise.
   * **Clearing Event Logs:** Erase event logs to hide actions performed on the system.
   * **Rootkit Installation:** Install rootkits to hide malicious activities.
7. **Exploiting Services**
   * **Database Exploitation:** Exploit databases for data retrieval and manipulation.
   * **Web Application Attacks:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications hosted on the server.
   * **MS Office Macro Exploitation:** Exploit macros in Microsoft Office documents for code execution.
8. **Resource Abuse**
   * **CPU and Memory Usage:** Exploit resources for cryptocurrency mining or denial-of-service attacks.
   * **Network Scanning:** Scan the internal network for potential targets.
