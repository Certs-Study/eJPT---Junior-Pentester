# Linux Post Exploitation

Understanding post-exploitation methodologies in a Linux environment is crucial for cybersecurity professionals.&#x20;

Here's an overview of the Linux post-exploitation methodology:

### **Information Gathering**

* **System Identification:** Identify the Linux distribution, kernel version, and other system details.
* **User Enumeration:** Enumerate users and their privileges on the compromised system.

### **Privilege Escalation**

* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
* **Abusing Sudo Permissions:** Exploit misconfigurations in sudo permissions to gain higher privileges.
* **Kernel Exploits:** Look for kernel vulnerabilities that can be exploited for privilege escalation.

### **Maintaining Persistence**

* **Backdoors:** Install backdoors for persistent access.
* **Cron Jobs:** Create scheduled tasks for continuous access.
* **SSH Keys:** Add SSH keys for persistent remote access.

### **Lateral Movement**

* **SSH Tunnels:** Establish SSH tunnels for accessing other systems in the network.
* **Pass-the-Hash (PtH):** Use compromised credentials to move laterally within the network.
* **Exploiting Trust Relationships:** Leverage trust relationships between systems to move across the network.

### **Data Exfiltration**

* **Compression and Encryption:** Compress and encrypt sensitive data before exfiltration.
* **Covert Channels:** Use covert channels for stealthy data transfer.

### **Covering Tracks**

* **Log Tampering:** Modify or delete logs to erase traces of the compromise.
* **Clearing Shell History:** Erase command history to hide executed commands.
* **Rootkit Installation:** Install rootkits to hide malicious activities.

### **Exploiting Services:**

* **Database Exploitation:** Exploit databases for data retrieval and manipulation.
* **Web Application Attacks:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications hosted on the server.

### **Resource Abuse**

* **CPU and Memory Usage:** Exploit resources for cryptocurrency mining or denial-of-service attacks.
* **Network Scanning:** Scan the internal network for potential targets.
