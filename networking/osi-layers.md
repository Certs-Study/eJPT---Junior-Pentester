### **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**

Deals with the physical connection between devices, including the transmission and reception of raw bit streams over physical media such as cables or wireless.

### **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**

Responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes, addressing errors in the physical layer and ensuring a consistent flow of data.

### **Network Layer (Layer 3)**

Manages the routing of data packets between devices on different networks. It addresses logical addressing and determines the best path for data to reach its destination.

### **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**

Ensures reliable data transfer between devices across a network. It handles end-to-end communication, error recovery, and flow control.

### **Session Layer (Layer 5)**

Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications. It manages sessions, allowing for data exchange and synchronization between applications on different devices.

### **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**

Handles data translation, encryption, and compression, ensuring that the data sent from the application layer of one system can be properly read by the application layer of another.

### **Application Layer (Layer 7)**

Provides network services directly to end-users or applications. It enables communication between software applications, including functions like file transfers, email, and remote login.
