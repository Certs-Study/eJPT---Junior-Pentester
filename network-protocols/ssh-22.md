# ðŸŸ¢ SSH 22

### What is SSH Penetration Testing?

SSH penetration testing, or Secure Shell penetration testing, involves assessing the security of SSH servers. SSH is a network protocol that allows for secure remote login from one computer to another. Penetration testers look for vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit, aiming to identify and patch security issues before an attacker can discover and leverage them.

### Goals of SSH Penetration Testing

* **Identify Weak Authentication**: Check for weak passwords and keys that could be easily guessed or brute-forced.
* **Inspect SSH Configuration**: Analyze the SSH server configuration for any misconfigurations or outdated protocols.
* **Evaluate Encryption Strength**: Examine the encryption algorithms and ciphers used to ensure they're strong and secure.
* **Test Access Controls**: Verify that the access controls are properly enforcing who can log in and what they can do on the server.

### Penetration Testing Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gather information about the target SSH server.
2. **Scanning**: Use tools like Nmap to identify open SSH ports and services.
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Apply vulnerability scanners such as Nessus or OpenVAS to find known vulnerabilities.
4. **Exploitation**: Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
5. **Post-Exploitation**: Assess the impact of a successful breach and what data or controls can be compromised.
6. **Reporting**: Document findings, evidence, and recommendations for improving security.
